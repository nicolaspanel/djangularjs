Feel free to fork and improve/enhance [DjangularJS](https://github.com/nicolaspanel/djangularjs), [grunt-djangularjs-translate](https://github.com/nicolaspanel/grunt-djangularjs-translate) or [generator-djangularjs](https://github.com/nicolaspanel/generator-djangularjs) in any way your want.

If you feel that the community will benefit from your changes, please send a pull request :

 - Fork the project.
 - Make your feature addition or bug fix.
 - Add documentation if necessary.
 - Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally (run grunt test or npm test).
